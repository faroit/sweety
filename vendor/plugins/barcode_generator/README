BarcodeGenerator
================
Author : Anuj Luthra
Barcode generator makes generating/displaying bar-codes for certain 
alphanumeric ids a piece of cake.
It uses Gbarcode for encoding barcode data and then rmagick to generate 
images out of it for displaying in views.

This way we can generate any barcode type which Gbarcode -> Gnome Barcode project
supports.

USAGE:

its as simple as saying 
<%= barcode 'FJJ4JD'%> 

This will generate a barcode for FJJ4JD in BARCODE_39 format with default width
and height and include it in the view.
the images are stored in /public/images/barcodes subdir.

Options Options Options ..

to customize your barcodes, you can optionally pass following information in your views 
 - encoding_format (Gbarcode constants for eg. Gbarcode::BARCODE_128 etc..)
 - width
 - height
 - scaling_factor
 - xoff
 - yoff
 - margin
 - no_ascii (accepts boolean true or false, prevents the ascii string from printing at 
             the bottom of the barcode)
 
in this case your view will look like :
<%= barcode 'ANUJ', :height => 100, 
                    :width  => 400,
					:margin => 100,
					:xoff   => 20,
					:yoff   => 40
%> 

Installation:
install from svn : http://barcode-generator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ 
make sure that you install 
 - gem for gbarcode
 - install native ImageMagick library 
and then run the rake task : rake barcode_setup
